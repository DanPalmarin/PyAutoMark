BUGS
(1) (Low priority)
- If the key question input is something like:
	Q3 = ("L2: 1 item", "L3: 5 items")
then it doesn't match student work. But
	Q3 = "L2: 1 item\nL3: 5 items"
works just fine.


IMPROVEMENTS
(1)
- The “Run assignments” button handler contains duplicated code used grading the assignments.
- Possibly have a function that runs one assignment given the zip file location/name, and iterating through them. Not entirely sure if it’s needed, but it would allow the code to comply more with code standards. (D.R.Y. : Don’t Repeat Yourself) 


(2)
- It could also be possible to grade the assignments within a separate process, so that if multiple students have infinite loops, the program wont hang for several seconds.


(3) Directory functionality. When you go to select an assignment key, moodle zip, or individual assignment zips, and you already have some selected, if you press 'cancel', it clears what was selected. Do we want this?
