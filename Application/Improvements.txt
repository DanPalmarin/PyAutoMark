BUG
- Reset button closes program.

- Clear and running program again seems to yield some blanks in the grades (try CS30 A8 to A9 or between A9 and A10).

- If the key question input is something like:
Q3 = ("L2: 1 item", "L3: 5 items")
then it doesn't match student work. But
Q3 = "L2: 1 item\nL3: 5 items"
works just fine.

Done:

- Increase names table column width
- Alphabetize names from last names
- Automatically generate 'ANUM_Feedback.zip'
- Before doing the above two points, make two radio buttons (CS20 and CS30). The config file will update according which is selected.
- Merge Moodle interface into the main window
- Make the 'submissions' folder directory to default to the location of the Moodle zip
- Reorganize all solution keys to be in same folder (one for CS30 and one for CS20)
- Reorganize all students submissions to be in the same folder (one for CS30 and one for CS20)
- Make moodle extraction overwrite previous files of the same name
